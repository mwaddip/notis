/**
 * Spec G phase D — the decay equivalence gate.
 *
 * Spec G D10: moving the decay clock from box `createdAtBlock` onto the
 * committed `IdentityRecord` is a **representation swap and must be
 * behaviour-identical**. The same owners decay, at the same heights, by the
 * same amounts. Any difference is a bug in this phase, not a design
 * improvement, however sensible it looks.
 *
 * These fixtures were captured from the **pre-swap** implementation, before any
 * phase-D source edit. That ordering is the whole point: captured afterwards
 * they would encode the new behaviour as correct and check nothing at all.
 *
 * The timelines run against production code — the real store, the real block
 * journal, `deriveKarmaDecay`. See
 * `test/harness/decay-timeline.ts` for why a fake store would have made this
 * vacuous.
 *
 * **Do not regenerate this fixture.** The capture path below refuses to
 * overwrite an existing file for exactly that reason; making it write again
 * takes a deliberate `rm`, which is a thing a reviewer can see in a diff.
