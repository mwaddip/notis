/**
 * Spec G phase D — the one ledger shape where the two clocks disagree.
 *
 * The equivalence gate (`decay-golden.test.ts`) covers the shape production is
 * normally in: forced karma consolidation (Spec G D9) leaves at most one karma
 * box per owner, so "oldest non-decay box" and "last activity" are the same
 * height. When an owner holds **two** non-decay karma boxes at different
 * heights, they are not:
 *
 *   - the pre-swap `owedPeriods` charges from the **oldest** non-decay box;
 *   - the identity record carries the **newest** activity.
 *
 * That shape is reachable — settlement karma outputs do not consolidate, so
 * an invite grant and a later like payout to the same owner both land beside
 * existing holdings (NODE_INTERFACE → The settlement transaction). Neither
 * spends what the recipient already holds.
 *
 * **This is an accepted, deliberate deviation — not an incidental one.** An
 * `owedPeriods` equivalence argument would need the premise that forced
 * consolidation leaves normally one karma box (oldest == newest == last touch).
 * That premise is false: the settlement emits a fresh karma output per leg
 * rather than merging into the recipient's existing box, so any block that
 * credits an owner who already holds karma leaves two non-decay karma boxes
 * standing.
 *
 * Decay is therefore measured from the most recent activity rather than from
 * the oldest surviving box, which is the clock NODE_INTERFACE → "Karma decay
 * (periodic burn)" states: `owedPeriods` reads
 * `max(lastActivityBlock, lastDecayBlock)`. This file is the pinned record of
 * the difference, kept out of the golden set so that neither can be mistaken
 * for the other.
 *
 * The frozen `preSwap` capture stays in the fixture as the baseline the
 * divergence is measured against; the equivalence gate's fixtures are
 * unaffected.
