 * passed to `startBlockCreator: (cfg: typeof testConfig) => void`, a parameter
 * typed as the incomplete literal itself — a declaration that mentions `Config`
 * nowhere and therefore checks the argument against itself. The parameter is
 * `Config` now, in all twelve. Verified by probe rather than by argument:
 * changing one `Config` field's type (`creditTreasuryPct: number → bigint`)
 * failed all twelve; before, it could not have reached any of them.
 *
 * Note what this design does with a newly *required* field: it fills it with the
 * value production runs with, silently and correctly, rather than failing the
 * build. That is deliberate — the fixtures track production instead of drifting
 * from it — but it means a field a test needs to *deviate* on must still be
