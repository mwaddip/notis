 * so an owner holding karma with no record should be unreachable. It is still a
 * total function's job to say what happens if one appears, and "never observed
 * active" is the honest reading: maximally stale, decaying from height 0.
 *
 * The alternative — skipping record-less owners — is the more dangerous
 * failure: it exempts an identity from decay permanently, and does so silently.
