/**
 * The per-identity decay clock — the second committed entity alongside boxes
 * (Spec G D4). Once boxes carry no height, `decay.ts` has nothing to read from
 * them, and consensus may not read an uncommitted store column, so the clock
 * lives in committed state:
 *
 *   stale       = (height − lastActivityBlock) >= staleThresholdBlocks
 *   owedPeriods = floor( (height − max(lastActivityBlock, lastDecayBlock)) / interval )
 *
 * `>=`, not `>`: an identity last active at `A` is stale iff
 * `A <= height − threshold`, i.e. `height − A >= threshold`. A `>` is off by
 * one; `decay.ts` carries the full argument.
 *
 * **Who populates this.** `insertBox` bumps `lastActivityBlock` from the
 * open journal's height for every karma box with `decayBurn !== true`;
 * `applyKarmaDecay` bumps `lastDecayBlock` when it fires; and
 * `ensureSystemKarmaBox` writes genesis's own record, since it runs outside
 * block application where the choke point has no height to read.
 *
 * **Key type is `UserId`** — the raw 32 Ed25519 public-key bytes, and there is
 * deliberately no separate identity type. Box `owner`/`likerId`/`inviterId`/
 * `voucherId` are the same pubkey and all `UserId`, so key rotation would have
 * to move box ownership too: the two move together or not at all, and branding
 * two semantically identical things buys no safety while costing a cast at
 * every boundary.
 *
 * The SQL table keys on those raw bytes; the **AVL** key is derived from them
 * (see `identityRecordKey`). Both are total functions of the identity, so the
 * two representations cannot drift.
