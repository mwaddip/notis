# Journal Events Contract

**Version:** 1.0
**Stability:** stable
**Last verified against code:** 2026-08-06

> ⚠ **PARTIAL — most of this document describes events nothing emits. Re-derived 2026-08-14.**
> **20 events are declared below, and 3 have no emitter in any package's `src`:**
> `migration_started`, `migration_complete`, `sync_complete`.
>
> The other 14 names occur somewhere in `src`, but **occurring is not emitting** — a name can
> appear in a type or a comment, and **how many of the 14 reach `emitEvent` has never been
> derived.** Treat every event here as unimplemented unless you have found its emitter.
> "Stability: stable" refers to the *format contract* for events that are emitted; it is not a
> claim that the events exist.
>
> ⚠ **`migration_started` / `migration_complete` cannot be emitted as declared.** They carry
> `from_version` and `to_version`, and there is no stored schema version to read: the five
> `migrate*` passes in `node/src/store/db.ts` run unconditionally, with no number selecting
> which. **The field lists are the open question, not the emitters.**
>
> ⚠ **`sync_complete` is not `@dagsocial/node`'s to emit alone.** `SyncMachine.onSynced` is
> public, but `NetNode` registers the callback internally and exposes no passthrough, so this
> needs a `@dagsocial/net` change first.

> ⚠ **Two different things share the word "journal" and this document covers only one.**
> **This file** = the JSON-line **observability event log**. **`BlockJournal` / `BoxMutation`**
> (Spec B P1) = the **record-once consensus mutation log** at the store choke point, which
> feeds the AVL prover and the `stateRoot`. They are unrelated. `BlockJournal` is specified
> in `NODE_INTERFACE.md → Store Interface → Block Journal`, **not here.** Do not reason from
> one to the other.

## Format

JSON-line output. Each line is a single JSON object with these required
fields:

```json
{
  "event": "<marker-prefix>",
  "level": "INFO",
  "timestamp": "2026-07-26T..."
}
```

Event-specific fields are additional top-level keys.

**Stability classification:**
- `stable`: Marker prefix, field names, field types, and emission
  preconditions frozen across the major version. Removal requires a
  major bump and a deprecation release.
- `experimental`: New events start here. May change or be removed in
  minor versions.

**Version advertisement:** `GET /health` returns `journalEventsVersion`.

## Lifecycle Events

### server_starting
**Level:** INFO
**Fields:** `version` (string), `network` (string)
**Emitted:** First line after logger init, before any I/O.

### server_ready
**Level:** INFO
**Fields:** `bind_address` (string), `admin_address` (string),
  `duration_ms` (number)
**Emitted:** After all subsystems are up and accepting traffic.

### shutdown_signal_received
**Level:** INFO
**Fields:** `signal` (string)
**Emitted:** On SIGTERM or SIGINT.

### server_shutting_down
**Level:** INFO
**Fields:** `reason` (string)
**Emitted:** After final flush, before process exit.

## Phase Timing Events

### db_open_started
**Level:** INFO
**Fields:** `path` (string)
**Emitted:** Before opening the SQLite database.

### db_open_complete
**Level:** INFO
**Fields:** `duration_ms` (number)
**Emitted:** After the SQLite database is open and its migrations have run.

> ✅ **Both are emitted, and `initDb` brackets itself.** `db_open_complete` fires at the **end** of
> `initDb`, past `createMempoolGateIndexes` — a sixth pass after the five `migrate*` calls — since
> the contract's "after the migrations have run" means after the last pass the database needs to be
> usable, not after the five that carry the `migrate` prefix.

### api_listening
**Level:** INFO
**Fields:** `bind_address` (string), `port` (number)
**Emitted:** After `app.listen()` succeeds on the public API port.

## Core Events

### post_received
**Level:** INFO
**Fields:** `post_id` (string), `source` (string: "local" or peer_id)
**Emitted:** On post arrival via gossip or local API.

### post_validated
**Level:** INFO
**Fields:** `post_id` (string), `validation_duration_ms` (number)
**Emitted:** After all validation phases pass.

### post_indexed
**Level:** INFO
**Fields:** `post_id` (string), `depth` (number)
**Emitted:** After post is stored and linked into the DAG.

### pow_verification_failed
**Level:** WARN
**Fields:** `post_id` (string), `reason` (string)
**Emitted:** On PoW check failure.

### dag_reorg
**Level:** WARN
**Fields:** `fork_point` (string), `demoted` (number), `old_tip` (string),
  `new_tip` (string)
**Emitted:** After canonical branch switch completes.

## Anomaly Events

### validation_stuck
**Level:** WARN
**Fields:** `post_id` (string), `reason` (string), `attempt_count` (number)
**Emitted:** When the same post fails validation for 5+ consecutive sweeps.

### dag_height_drift
**Level:** WARN
**Fields:** `gap` (number), `mode` (string), `old_height` (number),
  `new_height` (number)
**Emitted:** At most once at startup when databases disagree on validated
  height. Absence = databases agreed.

## Peer Events

### peer_connected
**Level:** INFO
**Fields:** `peer_id` (string), `direction` (string: "inbound" | "outbound")
**Emitted:** After handshake completes.

### peer_disconnected
**Level:** INFO
**Fields:** `peer_id` (string), `reason` (string)
**Emitted:** On disconnect.

### peer_penalised
**Level:** WARN
**Fields:** `peer_id` (string), `kind` (string), `detail` (string | null)
**Emitted:** On protocol violation by a peer.

## Sync Events

### sync_complete
**Level:** INFO
**Fields:** `tip_height` (number), `duration_ms` (number)
**Emitted:** First time `synced() == true` after startup or after dropping
  out of sync.

## Migration Events

### migration_started
**Level:** INFO
**Fields:** `name` (string), `from_version` (number), `to_version` (number)
**Emitted:** Before migration N begins.

### migration_complete
**Level:** INFO
**Fields:** `name` (string), `duration_ms` (number), `rows_affected` (number)
**Emitted:** After migration N commits.

## What this contract is NOT

- NOT a complete list of every log line — only the stable, machine-parseable
  events
- NOT a guarantee of emission timing within a phase — only ordering between
  phases is guaranteed
- NOT a serialization format spec — the output is JSON-line, but the exact
  whitespace is unspecified
